dvswitch (0.9~rc1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Ben Hutchings ]
  * Added dvsource-alsa as an audio-only source
  * Create one encoding thread per processor, up to a maximum of 8
  * Add status overlay to make it more clear whether recording is enabled
  * Set display to black before a source is connected
  * Add static Makefile at top level
  * Override source frame aspect ratio in case of a mismatch, rather then
    warning about it - Alioth feature #311953
  * Fix APTs and validity flags in header block - Alioth bug #311836
  * List all needed libraries to the linker.  We were accidentally
    depending on the behaviour of GNU ld, which treats 'needed' as
    transitive by default - Debian bug #554310
  * Remove support for 44.1 kHz audio
  * Add update-po target for updating translation files
  * Fix build failure with ffmpeg 0.6
  * Fix crash at startup with ffmpeg 0.6 due to a new parameter check
  * Enable selection of Firewire DV devices by GUID, thanks to
    Manuel Virgilio
  * Implement dvsource-firewire-rtsp, to serve DV over RTSP (experimental)

  [ Carl Karsten ]
  * Add peak level indicators to VU-meter

  [ Wouter Verhelst ]
  * Add support for tally lights in dvsource-firewire/dvsource-v4l2-dv
  * Internationalize and add Dutch translation
  * Disable effects buttons until sufficient sources have connected.
    Pressing them before sources are connected would result in a crash.
  * Implement fading on an 8-bit scale
  * Disable record button if we can't record - Alioth bug #312329
  * Add tally light support to dvsource-firewire-rtsp
  * Install dvsource-firewire-rtsp into .../bin
  * Take over day-to-day maintenance from Ben

  [ Robin Gareus ]
  * Add dvsource-jack, similar to dvsource-alsa but for JACK audio sources

    - Fixed drag-selection when the pointer moves beyond the left or top
      edge of the display
